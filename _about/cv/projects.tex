    \entry*[2022] \textbf{Compiler for C-like language} \hfill \emph{Guide: Prof. Uday Khedker $\mid$ IIT Bombay}

        $\bullet$ Developed a compiler for a subset of C, supporting functions, scope levels, and control sequences

        $\bullet$ Used lex for tokenizing and yacc for parsing to construct the Abstract Syntax Tree and Three Address Code 

    \entry*[2020] \textbf{Red Plag: Plagiarism Checker} \hfill \emph{Guide: Prof. Amitabha Sanyal $\mid$ IIT Bombay}
	    
	    $\bullet$ Implemented a modified version of latent semantic analysis which calculates the cosine similarity between different vectors in the covariance matrix corresponding to the data
        
        $\bullet$ Added further functionality for reliable detection if the program is written in C++, Python, or Java for ignoring language-specific syntax

        $\bullet$ Built a user interface using Angular with a Django backend where registered users can upload and process files and view the similarities between the different pairs, visualised as a heat map

    \entry*[2021] \textbf{IITB Proc} \hfill \emph{Guide : Prof. Virendra Singh $\mid$ IIT Bombay}
        
        $\bullet$ Developed a 16-bit processor using VHDL to execute operations based on instruction format

        $\bullet$ Implemented a finite state machine for the execution of 15 instructions in a 6-stage pipeline

	% \entry*[2020\phantom{}] \textbf{Tetris} \hfill \emph{Self Project}

 %        $\bullet$ Developed a complete playable version of the game \textbf{Tetris} in Python using the \textbf{PyGame} library
        
 %        $\bullet$ Utilized the \textbf{seven-bag algorithm} to reduce flooding and drought of specific pieces
        
 %        $\bullet$ Implemented an algorithm that analyses the current situation of the game, calculates the best possible move, and makes the appropriate decision to maximise the increase in score
